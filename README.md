# Wordpress Theme
My WordPress theme project  
WordPress PHP school project

## Description  

### About
One of main tasks at web development course was to create an accessible functional site in WordPress. The website was to be hosted on localhost with the help of software like XAMPP which provides the Apache web server, MySQL database (actually MariaDB), Php and Perl (as command-line executables and Apache modules).
### Structure
Our task was not to overcomplicate the layout and follow the structure of header, main section, aside bar, and footer. I followed this guideline in my wireframe.  
I wanted my website to contain images. Even though every optimization guide recommends not to use pictures when it is not necessary, I still wanted to have this option because I wanted to practice with it and because it was integrated in my design.  
When I was working on my site I would always base my decision about my client needs because I strongly believe that when solving a problem, we should always answer our client needs, not wants. This is the main reason I decided to rearrange content on my website and use categories. I reworked information structure on the website and presented it to my client. 
Surely this meant more work and more time but my client was more than fine with it, if it meant best solution, and for the benefits and experience which this work would bring. Plus, I think it’s a good practice to over deliver.  
I always design with mobile first in mind, so my site is fully responsive and works in all major browsers.
### Visual focus
When I get to choose about project design I would usually tend to a much cleaner sort of minimalistic design, but this time I really wanted to experiment and create something different. Instead of classic dark font on white background I wanted to try dark background and white text. I got to be my own client, and provided myself with some vision, and managed to come up with a graphical style, color palette, stylescape and began to work on wireframe till I was pleased with it. 
### Optimization
After I implemented my website layout and added missing WordPress functionality as I describe in my documentation in detail, I managed to apply a lot of methods to optimize and increase my sites accessibility. I hope that I managed to create a good quality product. I ran a lot of automated and manual accessibility tests which I describe in detail in my documentation.  
I found solutions for image optimization which allow me to save loading time and provide good quality pictures to users with high resolution retina displays.
### Evaluation
During my work I ran into a lot of challenges and troubles. At first I created a loop for each category, but soon realize what a bad solution it was. Not only will I have to add code with every new category, it was also contradicting good practice of “DRY” (do not repeat yourself). It was a real challenge to redo everything and hand in my assignment in time, but thankfully WordPress has very good documentation and I managed to find a good solution, one loop that would go through each category.  
Even though I accomplished quite a lot for my website I think there is a lot that can be improved, especially when my website goes to live hosting. I would want to apply functionality improvements, work on my website security, get SLL certificate and antispam, install optimizations plugins and work further on design customization, change color not only for my background but for text and other elements as well.  
Lastly I want to say that when I started this project and decided not to give up on my planning, I understood that I was lacking a lot of knowledge, I have never seen PHP before. But I am happy that I didn’t give up and simplified my design. Researching and learning new things was very exciting and rewarding. I know my end product is not perfect but I took a really long leap and covered a huge knowledge gap in WordPress. That was absolutely delightful to research and find solutions and see things which I wanted to implement work!  
I learned a lot about WordPress functionality, functions and plugins. I acquired a good understanding about what accessibility means for a website, as well as security and integrity.  
Right now I feel confident about creating any common website with WordPress by taking an empty theme and adjusting it according to my needs. By common I mean not e-commerce and similar, which will require more knowledge and research at this point. WordPress offers almost endless possibilities. I really enjoyed learning and working on this task.
